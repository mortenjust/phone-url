# How is this different from Google Voice? #
First of all, Google Voice isn't available outside the US. Secondly, phone-url is meant to be useful when ?_traveling_. Buy a local pay-as-you-go sim card and simply point your phone-url to that SIM card, and you're still reachable, and don't have to suffer the extreme roaming charges. We're not trying to compete with Google voice, in fact, we think it makes sense to use phone-url for your Google Voice numbers in different countries (when and if possible).

# Are URLs the best alternative to phone numbers? #
Right now, yes. In the future, no, but URLs could easily serve as a human-friendly fallback. Just like websites do today: You're able to make a good guess at a company's website, but never their phone number. You're able to search and find a company's website in a few clicks, but not their phone number.

# What is so wrong with phone numbers? #
Two things: They're impossible to remember or guess. They are tied to your mobile phone operator. True, most countries have number portability, but it takes weeks if not months. We believe you should be able to switch numbers instantly.
