## Gain independency from Google Latitude ##
Currently the system relies on the user entering a Latitude badge feed URL. If that is not done, the system does not choose a phone number, and does not display the local time.

## First-run experience ##
Design draft: FirstRunExperience

## Download vCard/hCard ##

## Local timezone support ##
Currently the system relies on geonames for local time. This is not dynamic data and could be hosted within the project

## Authentication ##
Give your phone url to anyone, maintain lists of who can see and use your number, Skype, or other means of contacting you. The lists could be defined by Facebook or GMail contacts accessed via their APIs

## Authorize with Google Latitude ##
Currently the system uses a public Latitude badge URL. While the user's location is not visible to other users, authorizing with the API and having the user grant phone-url access to their location would be the right thing to do.

## Add more providers ##
GTalk, Gizmo, etc.

## Change appearance ##
If on iPhone make the call page look like the iPhone's contact view, etc.
