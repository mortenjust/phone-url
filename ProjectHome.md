Phone-URL aims to be the transition away from phone numbers. We invite you to join our effort to help build an independent infrastructure to help users route calls wherever they wish, using which ever provider they want, at any given time, free and independently, hosted or self-hosted.

**Our first milestone is to eliminate the extreme international roaming costs without having to be unreachable to contacts without the user's local phone number.**

## Roaming tariffs ##
Pre-paid plans with reasonable data tariffs are available in most countries. A part of this project is to maintain an overview of providers in different countries so our users know which operator shop to go to when first landed in a new country.
