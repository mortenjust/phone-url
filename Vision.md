# A world without phone numbers #

There are at least two major problems with phone numbers

  1. They're almost impossible to remember, and certainly can't be guessed
  1. They're tied to the phone operator, who uses it to charge out of this world roaming rates

# Vision #
  * No phone number
  * No need to worry about giving out your number to strangers
  * Never pay unfair roaming prices for data, voice or text
  * When these points have been met, with or without our influence, we can stop this project

# What it is #
  * An infrastructure for routing calls to the right user
  * A way for everyone to fight the extreme costs of mobile phone roaming
  * Software that can be built in to mobile phones and other phone equipment to support this
  * Backwards compatible as far as we can get
  * Hosted by anyone, using any technology (even DNS like Telnic), as long as phone urls are compatible with each other
  * Working with as many current infrastructure providers as possible, be it operators, OpenID providers, web services.
  * A way to protect privacy
  * A way to know which local provider to choose for fair priced pre-paid data and voice calls.

# What it's not #
  * A VOIP service
  * A lock-in mechanism
  * Google Voice
